# This Action is triggered when a new release tag is created in the repository.
# Based on: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration#github-actions
# It packages and publishes the extension to the VSCode marketplace.

# The publish will only have an effect if the version number was bumped in the `package.json`,
# else it will complete this job, and silently fail to publish an update on the marketplace.
